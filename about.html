<h1>Chairman Message</h1>
<h6>Assalam-o-Alaikum</h6>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<g>Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times over? (Surat Baqara, Verse 245)</g>
<br>
<br>
<g>It should be noted that Allah, who is in need of no one and nothing, until He upon his mess to give Qarz-e-Hasna because it is a man's turn to be bugged whilst spending his wealth. Allah speaks about spree before it is returned and Allah promises that He will return the goodly loan to him. To folks who give their money to the Needy through the Holy Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H) promising 'Needy' Muslims to spend their wealth in a certain way. In case of children of Adam Trust and Needy with your wealth. If you do so, no fear. Flood or famine there will be able to come to you off your money. Instead, Allah will not only take strict accountability from those people but He will also punish them accordingly. On the Day Of Judgement, the rich will be humiliated because they did not help the needy. The needy will complain to Allah and say that all those men in whom you graciously bestowed the rights of wealth showed negligence to these poor but they were busy spending on themselves and giving about us, the ones who needed it. Allah will reply to this and say 'I warn you to take and feed them further away.'
</g>

<br>
<g>Alhamd-o-lillah Allah has accorded our organisation with the highest favour by sending those people our way who follow the teachings of the Holy Quran and Hadith, give zakat, fitrah, khairat and other donations to help us those in need. The purpose of sending this message to you is not only to spread this message to others but also play your part in helping us to continue serving and helping the needy till the Day of Judgement.</g>
